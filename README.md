### Audio Visual Language Learning App for Blackfoot 
Contributor- Tony Wu


In this project, I will be developing an audio-visual Language Learning app for the endangered Canadian Indigenous language, Blackfoot. This language has an oral tradition, and therefore this app will show images to the user while playing audio, to help them associate word sounds to objects such as apples, child, etc. This project is a collaboration with Dr. Eldon Yellowhorn in the Indigenous Studies Department, and the Peigan Board of Education in Lethbridge, Alberta.

The application has 3 parts:

Learn- Images are shown to the user while listening to the audio. By pressing Enter, the user can listen to words and see their corresponding image.

Play- The application will play the audio for a word, then show the user images of several items, possibly overlapped. Then it will ask the user to count how many of the images corresponding to the spoken word they see. The user will enter a number, and will be informed if their answer (i.e. their count) is correct or not.

Settings- By default, the user learns 3 words, but the user can add more words to learn and play with as they progress.
